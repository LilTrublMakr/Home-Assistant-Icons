# Home Assistant Icons

This repository is aimed to provide icons that people have created for their dashboard.

These icons are mostly for the configuration that Mattias' has graciously set up and shared his configuration for his dashboard. ([GitHub Link](https://github.com/matt8707/hass-config), [Home Assistant Community Topic](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/a-different-take-on-designing-a-lovelace-ui/162594))

## How to use

As of 11/2022, you should be able to copy and paste the code of the icon in to the `icon.yaml` file in the `button-card-template` folder.

## How to contribute

Pull requests are encouraged and welcome.
